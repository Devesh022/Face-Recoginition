<h4>Face Recognition Project</h4>

<h5>Overview</h5>
This project implements a face recognition system using advanced machine learning techniques. The system is capable of identifying and verifying individuals based on their facial features, providing accurate and efficient recognition in various scenarios.

<h5>Features</h5>

Face Detection: Identifies and locates human faces within images or video streams.
Face Recognition: Matches detected faces against a known database of individuals.
Real-time Processing: Supports real-time face recognition using live video feeds.
High Accuracy: Achieves high recognition accuracy with minimal false positives.
Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets and multiple faces simultaneously.

<h4>Technology Stack</h4>
<h6>Programming Language: Python</h6>

Libraries:
OpenCV: For image and video processing.
face_recognition: For face recognition tasks.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Flask (optional): To deploy the face recognition system as a web service.
Hardware: GPU (optional, for faster processing)
