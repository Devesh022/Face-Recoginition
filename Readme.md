##Face Recognition Project
#Overview
This project implements a face recognition system using advanced machine learning techniques. The system is capable of identifying and verifying individuals based on their facial features, providing accurate and efficient recognition in various scenarios.

#Features
Face Detection: Identifies and locates human faces within images or video streams.
Face Recognition: Matches detected faces against a known database of individuals.
Real-time Processing: Supports real-time face recognition using live video feeds.
High Accuracy: Achieves high recognition accuracy with minimal false positives.
Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets and multiple faces simultaneously.
##Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
#Libraries:
OpenCV: For image and video processing.
face_recognition: For face recognition tasks.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Flask (optional): To deploy the face recognition system as a web service.
Hardware: GPU (optional, for faster processing)
